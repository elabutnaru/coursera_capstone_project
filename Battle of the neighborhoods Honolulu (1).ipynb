It has an area of 177.2 km² and a population of 351,792 (as of 2016)."

That calls for a search algorithm that returns the requested feature, such as: population rate, average house prices, school ratings, crime rates, weather conditions, recreational facilities etc. In this context it would be highly commendable to have access to a hassle-free application that could split out an extensive analysis of all these characteristics for a neighborhood or a comparative analysis between neighborhoods."
